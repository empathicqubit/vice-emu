<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">VICE is a program that runs on a 
Unix, MS-DOS, Win32, OS/2, Acorn RISC OS, BeOS, QNX 4.x, QNX 6.x, Amiga, GP2X, 
SkyOS or Mac OS X machine and executes programs intended for the old 8-bit 
computers. The current version emulates the C64, the C64DTV, the C128, the 
VIC20, almost all PET models, the PLUS4 and the CBM-II (aka C610). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">VICE is the one and only 
<EM>Versatile Commodore Emulator</EM>. It provides emulation of the Commodore 
C64, C64DTV, C128, VIC20, PET, PLUS4 and CBM-II computers within a single 
package. The emulators run as separate programs, but have the same user 
interface, share the same settings and support the same file formats. </P>
<P><STRONG>Important notice:</STRONG> If you have no idea what a Commodore 8-bit 
computer is, or have questions about how these machines are used, how the file 
formats work or anything else that is not strictly related to VICE, you should 
read the appropriate FAQs <EM>first</EM>, as that kind of information is not 
available here. See&nbsp;the <A href="vice_14.html#SEC162">Contact information</A>. section for 
information about how to retrieve the FAQs. </P>
<P>All the emulators provide an accurate 6502/6510 emulator, with emulation of 
all the opcodes (both documented and undocumented ones) and accurate timing. 
Unlike other emulators, VICE aims to be cycle accurate; it tries to emulate chip 
timings as precisely as possible and does so <EM>efficiently</EM>. </P>
<P>Please do&nbsp;not expect the C64DTV, C128, PET, PLUS4 and CBM-II emulators 
to be as good as the C64 or VIC20 one, as they are still under construction.
