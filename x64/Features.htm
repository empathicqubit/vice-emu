<P><FONT size=2><FONT size=3 face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><U><STRONG>Features of 
the VICE Commodore 64 Emulator (x64)</STRONG></U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The C64 emulator, called 'x64', features a 
fairly complete emulation of the VIC-II video chip: sprites, all registers and 
all video modes are fully emulated. Custom palettes, gamma, contrast, and 
several other settings are configurable.The emulation has been fully 
cycle-accurate since version 0.13.0. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">A rather complete emulation of the SID 
sound chip is also provided. All the basic features are implemented as well as 
most of the complex ones including synchronization, ring modulation and filters. 
There are two emulators of the SID chip available: one is the "standard" VICE 
emulator, available since VICE 0.12; the other one is Dag Lem's reSID engine. 
The reSID engine is a lot more accurate than the standard engine, but it is also 
a lot slower, and only suitable for faster machines. Dual SID chips are also 
emulated and can be enabled in a configurable address space.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Naturally, both CIAs (or VIAs, in some 
cases) are fully emulated and cycle accurate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Kernal, basic, character, and drive roms 
can be swapped out in favor of 3rd party replacement roms. Some rom sets known 
to work are JiffyDos, DolphinDos, SpeedDos, and others.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">NTSC and PAL modes are also fully 
emulated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">A very powerful and robust ML monitor and 
debugger is built in that includes support not only for the main machine but 
also for emulated disk drives.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">x64&nbsp;also supports a large number of 
additional hardware devices and addons. Here's a&nbsp;good rundown of most of 
them:</FONT></P>
<UL dir=ltr>

  also includes up to 40k drive ram expansion, 35 -&gt; 40 track expansion, and 
  userport parallel support for various hardware drive speeders. In additon, 
  virtual device numbers can be mapped to a directory on the host PC to provide 
  access to the host's filesystem. Real physical IEC drives can also be 
  used&nbsp;in the emulator&nbsp;with the correct interface and&nbsp;OpenCBM 
  drivers installed.</FONT></DIV>
