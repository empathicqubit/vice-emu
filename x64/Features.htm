<P><FONT size=2><FONT size=3 face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><U><STRONG>Features of 
the VICE Commodore 64 Emulator (x64)</STRONG></U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The C64 emulator, called 'x64', features a 
fairly complete emulation of the VIC-II video chip: sprites, all registers and 
all video modes are fully emulated. Custom palettes, gamma, contrast, and 
several other settings are configurable.The emulation has been fully 
cycle-accurate since version 0.13.0. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">A rather complete emulation of the SID 
sound chip is also provided. All the basic features are implemented as well as 
most of the complex ones including synchronization, ring modulation and filters. 
Dual SID chips can be enabled in a configurable address space. Other SID support 
includes the HardSID, Catweasel Mk3, and ParSID PC&nbsp;hardware which provide a 
real&nbsp;SID chip to the PC.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">There are&nbsp;three emulators of the SID 
chip available:</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">First&nbsp;is the "standard" VICE "Fast 
  SID" emulator, available since VICE 0.12. It's fast and best suited for 
  old/slow PCs.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Another is Dag Lem's reSID engine. The 
  reSID engine is more accurate than the standard engine, but it is also a lot 
  slower, and only suitable for faster machines. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The third option is reSID-fp by alankila 
  which&nbsp;emulates both SID chip models (6581 and 8580) and offers the 
  ability to use the filters associated with the 6581-R3,R4,R4AR and 8580. It's 
  capable of emulating almost all filter quirks used by musicians for their 
  custom sounds.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Naturally, both CIAs (or VIAs, in some 
cases) are fully emulated and cycle accurate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Kernal, basic, character, and drive roms 
can be swapped out in favor of 3rd party replacement roms. Some rom sets known 
to work are JiffyDos, DolphinDos, SpeedDos, and others.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">NTSC and PAL modes are both fully 
emulated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Experimental netplay 
over&nbsp;TCP/IP&nbsp;has recently been added.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You can take screenshots and&nbsp;record 
the audio output of the emulated machine. Video can also be captured if the 
ffmpeg libraries are installed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">VICE shares the clipboard and you can copy 
and paste text to and from the PC and emulated machine. When pasting text to the 
emulator, it loads the keyboard buffer of the machine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">x64 supports saving the full machine state 
and restoring it later.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Input can be recorded to create playback 
histories with milestone saving and returning to milestones later.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">A very powerful and robust ML monitor and 
debugger is built in that includes support not only for the main machine but 
also for emulated disk drives.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">x64&nbsp;also supports a large number of 
additional hardware devices and addons. Here's a&nbsp;good rundown of most of 
them:</FONT></P>
<UL dir=ltr>
  <LI>
  <DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT 
  face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Full 4 drive IEC&nbsp;emulation of the 1541, 
  1541-II, 1570, 1571, and 1581. For drives that support such addons, emulation 
  also includes up to 40k drive ram expansion, 35 -&gt; 40 track expansion, and 
  userport parallel support for various hardware drive speeders. In additon, 
  virtual device numbers can be mapped to a directory on the host PC to provide 
  access to the host's filesystem. Real physical IEC drives can also be 
  used&nbsp;in the emulator&nbsp;with the correct interface and&nbsp;OpenCBM 
  drivers installed.</FONT></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT 
  face="Microsoft Sans Serif">IEEE488 emulation which allows additional drive 
  types to be emulated. (2031, 2040, 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and 
  8250)</FONT></FONT></DIV>
