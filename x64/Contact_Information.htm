<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">This is now the preferred way of 
submitting bugs, feature requests, and communicating with&nbsp;other VICE users 
on the forums. This is also the home of the subversion (SVN) 
development&nbsp;repository where little versions of VICE grow up to be big and 
strong.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Please read the following documents 
carefully before reporting a bug or a problem you cannot solve:</FONT> </P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">the VICE documentation (you are 
  reading it!)</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">the VICE FAQ&nbsp;at <A

  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">the comp.emulators.cbm and 
  comp.sys.cbm FAQs (see section FAQs you should read) </FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Before you report a bug or a feature 
request, please check the Sourceforge tracker to make sure it's not already been 
reported. If it has been reported and you have additional information 
about&nbsp;the bug or request, please dont hesitate to add it to the issue 
already posted.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">When you report a bug, please try to 
be as accurate as possible and describe how it can be reproduced to the very 
detail. You should also tell us what machine you are running on, what operating 
system you are using as well as the version of it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><STRONG>VICE Home 
Page</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You can also find the latest news, 
information, &nbsp;and links&nbsp;at the official VICE home page: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">(<A href="mailto:vice-devel@firenze.linux.it"><FONT size=2 
face="Microsoft Sans Serif">vice-devel@firenze.linux.it</FONT></A><FONT size=2 
face="Microsoft Sans Serif">)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">If you want to&nbsp;ask any 
questions&nbsp;or contribute to the project,&nbsp;you can email the 
VICE&nbsp;mailing list. Please remember that the proper way to submit a bug or 
make a feature request is to use the Sourceforge project page as there's much 
better tracking of issues there.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">It's always nice to receive feedback 
about VICE, but please read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in 
the team. </FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Please put the word 'vice' <EM>in 
  all capitals</EM> in your subject line (e.g., 'Thanks for making VICE!'). This 
  helps mail splitting and reduces chances that your message is unintentionally 
  deleted, forgotten or lost. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Please don't send any HTML mail 
  (we really hate that!). Make sure you turn off the "rich text" (HTML) feature. 
  </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Please don't send <EM>any</EM> 
  binaries without asking first. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Please don't ask us how to 
  transfer original C64 disk or tapes to your PC; this has been asked a 
  gazillion times through email. To transfer disks, you can use the OpenCBM 
  drivers and tools (<A 
  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencbm">http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencbm</A>) 
  and/or Star Commander (</FONT><A href="http://sta.c64.org/sc.html"><FONT 
  size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">http://sta.c64.org/sc.html</FONT></A><FONT 
  size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">). And no, you cannot read C64 disks with 
  your old 5 1/4" PC drive. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Please don't ask us where to find 
  games for the emulator on the Internet. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Please don't ask us when the next 
  version will be out, because we really don't know. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Please write in English. 
  </FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">In any case, we would be 
<EM>really</EM>&nbsp; glad to receive your comments about VICE. We cannot always 
answer all the email, but we surely read all of it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Thanks! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><STRONG>How to 
contribute</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">If you want to make a major 
contribution, please <EM>ask</EM>&nbsp; first. It has already happened a couple 
of times that somebody started working at something that had already been done 
but not released to the public yet, and we really do <EM>not</EM>&nbsp; want 
anybody to waste time. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The bleeding edge development source 
of VICE is available for chekout from SVN on the Sourceforge project page. 
Please try to develop your patch against this source </FONT><FONT size=2 
face="Microsoft Sans Serif">and provide us with the following: </FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">a unified diff file containing 
  all the changes you have made 'diff -u' is fine; please don't use plain 'diff 
  ' </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">GNU-style 'Changelog' entries 
  with a description of the changes you have made (look at the&nbsp;'Changelog's 
  provided with the original VICE sources for an example). </FONT><FONT size=2 
  face="Microsoft Sans Serif">This is very important, and makes adding patches 
  much smoother and safer.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">People willing to port VICE to other 
platforms are always welcome. But notice from experience it will take at least a 
full year of continious work to write a well working and stable port.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><STRONG>Interesting 
newsgroups</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif">There are some Usenet newsgroups you 
might be interested in: </FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT size=2 
  face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><U>comp.emulators.cbm</U>&nbsp;discussion about 
  emulators of Commodore 8-bit machines (definitely not Amiga emulators). 
</FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><U>comp.sys.cbm</U> discussion 
  various topics regarding real Commodore 8-bit machines. This newsgroup is 
  mainly for people who actually use original Commodore equipment (so please 
  don't talk about emulation here).</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><FONT size=2><U>comp.emulators.misc</U> 
  discussing emulators in general.</FONT></FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><STRONG>FAQs you should
